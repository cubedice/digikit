# CANOPY implementation

This directory contains the stage-1 sine kernel for the
[CANOPY design](../../../docs/design/canopy.md). It is **not an installable module**:
there is no machine manifest, V2 descriptor, firmware carrier integration or UI yet.
`src/dsp/instrument.s` now connects the production MIDI lifecycle bridge to this
kernel in instruction-core tests. Normal firmware builds do not link it or enable
keyboard routes.

`src/dsp/voice.s` implements four foreground notes, two short release tails and
four pending-replacement records in a caller-owned 256-byte bank.
Each note has its own token, gate, oscillator phase, velocity and linear envelope.
Attack is fixed at 80 ms; release falls at full-scale per second (a note released
during attack ends sooner). Output is mono, in 32-sample blocks at 48 kHz. The sine
rotator normalizes its phase vector once per block to limit numerical drift.
`src/dsp/tuning.s` supplies MIDI 0–127 coefficients at A4=440 Hz.

Note-on rejects duplicate tokens and invalid notes/velocities without changing
existing notes. Note-off matches the exact token and releases only that
note. Zero-velocity Note On must already have been normalized by MIDI ingress.
QUIET is returned only after every local release finishes, and the entire output
block is always written. Independent banks allow separate track state.

This is deliberately the lifetime-test kernel, not the finished instrument. It has
no sustain pedal, bend, chord modes, arp or preset controls. These
operations must not be advertised by a ready instrument yet.

The callback layer owns sixteen separate banks and a single 256-byte staging bank.
It applies each batch to staging and copies back only if every event succeeds.
Unknown releases are harmless; unsupported controllers and failed note allocation
reject the entire batch. The internal `CPS1` configuration schema accepts exactly
one word, value 1, selecting the fixed sine proof. It is not the release preset ABI.
Reset invalidates configuration and ramps affected voices down within 64 samples;
tails still render after reset ACK. A newer stream epoch resets all tracks.

When all four foreground slots are occupied, reclaim the quietest releasing note
first (oldest token breaks ties), otherwise the oldest held note. Preserve its
phase and gain in a free tail slot and fade it within 64 samples. If both tails
are occupied, fade the displaced note in its foreground slot and queue the new
onset there; it starts after at most two render blocks. Pending replacements can
themselves be replaced or released without sounding. Never-rendered intermediate
onsets need no audio tail. This allows an entire eight-event batch to commit
without rejecting it merely because four notes are held.

Token matching includes pending onsets. Releasing a stolen token cannot release
its replacement or lengthen its forced ramp. At most six sine oscillators sound
at once; the future arp group is not implemented. This fits the design's four
foreground/two shared-tail limit without adding hidden voices. Live routing still
requires the public V2 contract, carrier/AMP proof and supported controllers.

Run its concrete SHARC instruction-core checks with:

```sh
uv run python -m pytest tests/patchkit/test_canopy_voice.py -q
uv run python -m pytest tests/patchkit/test_canopy_instrument.py -q
uv run python -m pytest tests/patchkit/test_canopy_carrier.py -q
```

The tests check independent phase/velocity/release, exact token handling, capacity,
memory guards, silent idle output and pitch/envelopes across sustained renders.
Sustained checks cover one
second at MIDI notes 0, 69 and 127, then release to silence; waveform error against
the ideal sine/envelope stayed below 0.0002 in sample amplitude. This is a numerical
check, not a measured device CPU or latency claim.
Packet-to-kernel tests additionally cover schema rejection, atomic batch rollback,
independent track resets, note release, reset tails and stale generation rejection.
Allocator tests cover same-block bursts, delayed onsets, cancellation before onset,
reclaiming releases and stale note-offs after stealing.
The allocator checkpoint passed all 23 selected kernel, packet-integration and
frame-context tests, plus a focused quietest-release check. Lint, layering and
edited-doc path checks passed. The broader changed-file preflight still reports
256 existing stale references in 78 repository files.
The test-only raw adapter probe additionally checks pre-AMP output on inactive
tracks 0 and 15, preservation of note state across stock retriggers and velocity
changes, stereo copying without a second oscillator advance, and restarting a
quiet bank without a stock trigger. It checks register preservation and foreign
stores through the production voice adapter. It deliberately leaves stock ACTIVE
unchanged, including when the kernel becomes QUIET; this exposes the missing
carrier handoff rather than implementing one.

The internal `src/dsp/render.s` entry now publishes carrier controls through the
core adapter after each even-voice render. Connected component tests exercise
frame expiry, stereo sharing, envelope argument substitution and retirement
after configuration loss or reset. The final tail block remains ACTIVE; QUIET
and shared release occur on the following empty block. These sources are still
uninstalled. Connected tests now execute the workspace capture shim with a
synthetic workspace pointer instead of writing the envelope-record base directly.

The firmware carrier probe also connects the kernel and render publication to
the actual stock envelope in one execution core. Its bounded C/E/G scenario
checks independent release, low-then-high velocity, unchanged held audio through
AMP, and reset retirement. Stock configuration is loaded by the original DSP
caller from synthetic sustained settings. It still bypasses live MIDI ingress,
instance admission and the final filter/mixer path.

The probe additionally checks the stock gain builder and 32-sample application,
plus frame-velocity lookup across five curves. Curve 0 is constant across keys,
a candidate for neutral shared velocity. This does not yet establish an owned
velocity override or final mixer output.

These checks do not establish stock AMP lifetime, final track output, MIDI latency
or device performance. The current V1 contract path skips inactive stock voices
and clears configured state at stock note-on. The raw path avoids that contract
but does not initialize or sustain the downstream stock AMP. CANOPY still needs
the separate V2 lifecycle and carrier path described in the design before this
kernel can receive live input.
